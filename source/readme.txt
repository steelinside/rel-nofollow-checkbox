== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does it add any styles? =
Nope. You'll have to add .fancy-link class to your style.css by yourself, and style it as you want.
It may look like this:
.fancy-link{
  color: #9D4100;
  background-color: #FAD000;
  padding: 2px 5px;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

= Where is the options, dude? =
Sorry, no options. If you'll need more checkboxes, than dig into the code of wplink.min.js.
